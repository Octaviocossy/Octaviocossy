Hi! Iâ€™m Octavio, a Product Developer with a strong focus on building scalable, real-world software. I enjoy crafting modern web applications and developing AI-powered features that improve usability and automation.

Iâ€™m currently working at Janus Automation, creating custom web solutions for industrial clients. Iâ€™m also the co-founder of Anthurium Group ðŸŒ±, where I lead technical teams, mentor junior developers, and help companies boost productivity with tailored software.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into AI integrations to push my projects even further.
